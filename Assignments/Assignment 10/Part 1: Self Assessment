Assignment 10 – Final Assignment Self Assessment

To assess what grade I believe I should receive I am evaluating myself through a course-based approach. First, I will assess my participation. 
I did not miss any class meetings, and I was always present more than a minute before class started. I was engaged during class. I had my 
camera on for every meeting, and when I had questions I sent emails asking for assistance. I was involved during class since I would answer 
questions whether I was called on to answer or volunteered to answer. However, I believe I could’ve volunteered to answer more questions 
instead of waiting to be called on to answer. For every assignment I turned in, I believe I did my best even if my code had mistakes. I always
gave myself at least four days before the assignment was due to work on it, and when I had a question my class notes and troubleshooting 
couldn’t answer – adding /n to a String for example – I emailed my professor for help. All of my assignments compiled without errors, and all 
my assignments that had test code executed and produced the correct results. Even though I’m confident in the coding abilities I gained from 
this course, I still made mistakes in my assignments. In all my reflections I compared my code to the code in the grading notes and identified 
all the differences as well as the possible reasons for the differences. One mistake I made was not checking if an object was null, so I made a
point to check if an object or object’s head was null going forward. Another thing I made a conscious effort to improve on was making sure my 
code was concise. Overall, I believe my code is much more concise now compared to the beginning of the course, but compared to the grading notes,
my code could still be more concise. I believe this is due to the experience gap, and as I code more I’ll be able to create more advanced programs
with less code. Based on the above, I propose a course grade of A.
