This is my proposal for a way to represent the Trainline object.

I think that when a user uses the toString method on a Trainline object all the fields should be printed as well as the fields of each station 
in a TrainLine so the output should look like this: 

/**Printing out the fields in the TrainLine class in Week 5 where the only field is the station head*/

Station head: Howard
Next Station: Jarvis
NextStation: null

In this example, the first station in a TrainLine is Howard and the next station is Jarvis and there is no station after jarvis so null is printed. 
Each station name is also printed on its own line, and the next station is printed on a new line. 

/**Printing out the fields in the TrainLine class in Week 6 where the fields are head, tail, and number of stations*/

Using the fields in the TrainLine object from the Week 6 folder, I would print them similarily. Using the previous example, it would 
look like this: 

Head: Howard
Tail: Jarvis
Number of Stations: 2
